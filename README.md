<h1 align="center" id="title">30 Days Of Code</h1>

<p id="description">Committing to a new habit can be tough especially when you are just starting out. We have got for you the 30 days of Code challenge wherein you will be given a new coding problem every day at 12:00 AM IST and you have only 24 hours to submit your answers. The 30-day-challenge comprises of 21 different DSA topics and the cumulative scores of all the days shall determine your score.</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Topics to Cover Contests on platforms like Leetcode GeeksForGeeks(GFG) and CodeStudio are more based on DSA and not on competitive concepts. So for these contests you should have a good grip on below mentioned topics: Arrays Linked Lists Stack/Queue/Priority Queue Trees : Traversal questions and DFS approach are important Graphs : Graph algorithms like Dijkstra Floyd Warshall are important. Greedy Algorithm Dynamic Programming Union Find Two Pointer Approach Sliding Window

<h2>üç∞ Contribution Guidelines:</h2>

Don‚Äôt Miss Contests No matter you are busy with your exams or day to day work. You must take out some time to give the contest. Leetcode Biweekly contests are held alternating Saturdays at 8pm IST and Weekly contests are held every Sunday 8am IST. If by any chance you missed any contest attempt virtual contest. Virtual contests gives you an idea of what your ranking would be but It will not change your rating. Upsolve problems Generally people participate and then post contest they don‚Äôt try to solve unsolved problems or try to find a more optimized approach for the problem they have solved. Note this if you‚Äôll not upsolve you can‚Äôt learn anything from the contest.
